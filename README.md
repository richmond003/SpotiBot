# 🎧 SpotiBot

**SpotiBot** is a personalized Spotify playlist generator that helps users bring order and meaning to their music library — effortlessly.

## 🧠 What It Does

Spotibot analyzes a user’s **liked songs** on Spotify and automatically creates a **dedicated playlist for each artist** found in their collection. Each playlist contains only the tracks by that artist from the user’s liked songs.

This allows users to:
- Quickly find and enjoy all their saved songs from a specific artist
- Avoid manual playlist curation
- Reconnect with forgotten favorites in a more organized way

## 💡 Why It’s Useful

Spotibot solves a common problem: users often "like" hundreds of songs but never get around to organizing them. Over time, this can make it difficult to enjoy specific artists without scrolling endlessly.

Whether you're a casual listener or a music enthusiast, Spotibot creates a cleaner, smarter way to explore your own music taste — one artist at a time.
